1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,840
The fruit of that rot is here.

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:05,580
Violence, ugliness, derangement.

3
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:08,740
I know because I once shared that mindset.

4
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:12,560
I thought I was on the side of compassion, but I wasn't.

5
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:13,520
I was blind.

6
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:17,740
The programming we absorbed trained us to confuse cruelty with righteousness,

7
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:21,200
and we couldn't see what was right in front of us.

8
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:22,420
And here's the heart of it:

9
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:26,920
When we excuse or laugh at cruelty, when we rationalize violence as justice,

10
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:28,900
it doesn't just corrupt politics.

11
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:30,080
It corrupts us.

12
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:33,960
Without an anchor in truth, evil doesn't creep in quietly.

13
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:35,020
It takes over.

14
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:36,720
Yeah, it's shocking stuff.

15
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:37,520
And it's a pattern now.

16
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:39,340
We're seeing this happening on more and more campuses.

17
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:43,460
So at the University of California, Davis, our brave Turning Point USA chapter

18
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:46,620
was set to host Brandon Tatum as a 'prove me wrong' event.

19
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:47,800
Goes up, sets a table.

20
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:51,360
Anyone can go and have free speech and dialogue if they disagree.

21
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,840
And Antifa showed up full masked, black outfits.

22
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:57,940
They came in, took our gear, destroyed our tables.

23
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:02,820
Basically made the students had to flee, and the police did nothing to intervene.

24
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:03,920
Nothing whatsoever.

25
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:08,180
This is after one of our Turning Point USA students at University of Texas, Dallas,

26
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:13,600
had a bike lock thrown at her and actually had to be hospitalized for this treatment.

27
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,020
Sean, we are seeing a disturbing pattern from the radical left,

28
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:18,800
and we have data to now support it.

29
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,880
According to the National Contagion Research Institute,

30
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:27,700
48% of left of center respondents say that it's justified to murder Elon Musk.

31
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:32,020
53% say that it would be justified to murder President Donald Trump.

32
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,900
We have to take a step back here and ask our question.

33
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:34,920
What's really going on here?

34
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:37,920
There's a deeper thing than just political disagreement.

35
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:41,380
If you are on the front lines, like our Turning Point USA students,

36
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:44,480
you are potentially putting your safety, your well-being,

37
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:48,880
and - God forbid - your life in jeopardy, for simply being a conservative on a college campus.

38
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:53,700
If we can excuse the murder of a man for his words and call it progress,

39
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:56,940
something inside of us is already twisted.

40
00:01:56,940 --> 00:02:00,000
I know, because it was once twisted in me.

41
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,800
And so I'll leave you with this.

42
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:06,400
If mocking the dead and excusing political murder is where our politics has led us,

43
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,020
then it's time to step back and ask ourselves,

44
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:13,820
not just who the real monsters are, but whether we've already become them.

45
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:15,100
In violence, great.

46
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:27,920
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

47
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,440
I have the best news ever.

48
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:31,120
What?

49
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:32,700
Oh, Donald Trump died.

50
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:36,140
Uh, second best news.

51
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,020
What, the president died?

52
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:40,860
Okay, third best news.

53
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,260
That Elon Musk died?
